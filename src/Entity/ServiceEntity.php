 * All entities that are used in the in conjunction with data provider or persistence services must implement this interface.

 * A ServiceEntity class that implements this interface doesn't have to be much more than a plain data object,
 * but it may also extend from the Entity class provided CodeIgniter or other libraries,
 * but it should be avoided returning database connections or result objects from the data provider or persistence services,
 * as such things should not be accessible from the controller or and surely not from the view layer.
 *
 * The implementations of getPrimaryKeyValue() and setPrimaryKeyValue() must be compatible with each other and access
 * and modify the same field(s) and attributes(s) as returned by getPrimaryKeyName().
 * Additionally they return and accept the same values of the same amount in the same order and typing as specified by
 * the value returned by getPrimaryKeyName(). This should writing more strongly typed code and avoid errors.
 *
 * Note: You can use PHPStan's template annotations to specify the type of the primary key field(s) or attribute(s).
